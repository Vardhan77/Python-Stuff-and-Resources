The following are the list of major resources I'm using to learn Pyton:
1. codeacademy.org
 Since, its a paid site, I used resources made by ugo_py_doc to go through projects:
 https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_py_doc/Codecademy%20Python/
 Also, Codeacademy Projects are made into videos by Codeacadey professionals at:
 Bank Account Project : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=590&v=vr8iYUt8QAU
 RGB to Hex Convertor : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=112&v=1PpV-Qe6Qdo
 DNA Project : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2YdpkOwha4
 
 Another resource for solutions to problems in codeacdemy is compiled by ummahusla at :

2. Python 4 Everybody Course by University Of Michigan via Coursera, I audited the course:
 The course Instructor, Charles R Severance, has compiled the entire course into a book called Python 4 Everybody 
 which can be accessed at https://www.py4e.com/book.php 
 The book is very helpful and straight forward. The exercise problems were fun and precise.
